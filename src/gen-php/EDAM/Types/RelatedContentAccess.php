/**
 * This enumeration defines the possible ways to access related content.
 * 
 * NOT_ACCESSIBLE: The content is not accessible given the user's privilege level, but
 *     still worth showing as a snippet. The content url may point to a webpage that
 *     explains why not, or explains how to access that content.
 * 
 * DIRECT_LINK_ACCESS_OK: The content is accessible directly, and no additional login is
 *     required.
 * 
 * DIRECT_LINK_LOGIN_REQUIRED: The content is accessible directly, but an additional login
 *     is required.
 * 
 * DIRECT_LINK_EMBEDDED_VIEW: The content is accessible directly, and should be shown in
 *     an embedded web view.
 *     If the URL refers to a secured location under our control (for example,
 *     https://www.evernote.com/*), the client may include user-specific authentication
 *     credentials with the request.
